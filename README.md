# Grafting Tutorial

This starter kit aims to be a very minimalistic boilerplate to quickly get started with grafting an existing subgraph onto a new one. It is meant to accompany the [Grafting Guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/cookbook/grafting).

## Quick Start

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies in each subfolder: `cd graft-example && npm install` then `cd ../graft-replacement && npm install`
